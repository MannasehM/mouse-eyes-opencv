# Eye & Head Controlled Mouse (Prototype)
This is an experimental Python project that uses your head movement and blinks to control the mouse.
It uses OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI to detect your face landmarks, track head rotation, and detect blinks.

## Features (Work in Progress)
Head tracking → Move the mouse cursor by turning your head.

Blink detection → Click by holding your eyes closed for a short time.

Calibration → Press c to set a neutral head position.
